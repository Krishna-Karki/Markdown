# Markdown Editor - V0.1 Alpha

This repository hosts the source code for a simple and intuitive Markdown editor built using React and TypeScript. The editor allows users to write and preview Markdown content in real-time, making it easier to format text, code snippets, and more. This project is in the V0.1 Alpha stage, which means it is an early version and may still have some bugs and limited features.

## Features
- **Real-Time Preview**: As you type your Markdown text, the rendered HTML output is displayed side-by-side, allowing for instant feedback.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks within the Markdown are highlighted for easier reading and writing.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: A minimalist user interface that focuses on the writing experience, with responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that improves code quality and development experience.
- **Marked**: A low-level markdown compiler for parsing and converting Markdown to HTML.
